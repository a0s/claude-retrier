# claude-retrier — keep a Claude Code or codex session going, without tmux.
#
# One file. Wraps the agent in a PTY it owns, so it can BOTH see everything the
# session prints AND type into it — the two capabilities that forced the tmux
# design in claude-auto-retry (capture-pane + send-keys). Everything else (detached
# monitor, event markers, launchd/systemd reconcilers, shell-function installer)
# falls out as unnecessary.
#
# Usage:  claude-retrier.sh [claude args...]
#         claude-retrier.sh --cmd <your-claude> [claude args...]
#         claude-retrier.sh --agent codex --cmd codex [codex args...]
#         codex-retrier [codex args...]          # the same file, codex by default
#         claude-retrier.sh --cr-dump-python      # print the embedded Python (used by tests)
#         claude-retrier.sh --cr-models           # print the model profile table (T18)
#         claude-retrier.sh --cr-statusline <path> # statusline proxy (used via --settings, T20)
#         claude-retrier.sh --cr-version
#
# `--cmd` (or CR_CLAUDE_CMD) is whatever YOU type to start the agent: a binary, a
# script, a name on PATH, an alias or shell function from your ~/.zshrc, or a whole
# command line. Anything the wrapper cannot exec itself is run through your login
# shell, so rc-file aliases work exactly as they do when you type them.
#
# `--agent` (or CR_AGENT) picks whose transcript to read: claude or codex. The
# default works it out from the command being run, so naming it is only needed
# when that command hides which one it starts.
#
# Two things stop a session that is not finished, and it handles both: a usage
# limit, which states when it lifts and is waited out, and a server that refuses
# the turn ("Selected model is at capacity") — which states nothing, so it is
# nudged again after a minute, then two, then four. On codex that refusal takes
# every running agent down with it, which is what makes the nudge worth having.
#
# It can also restart a session that is running out of context window: at
# CR_CONTEXT_PCT of the window it asks for a handoff file, checks that the file
# really was written, clears the session and unfolds it from that file. Off
# unless you set CR_CONTEXT_PCT — see the README. How large the window is comes
# from the model slug; a model this file has never heard of is looked up over
# the network (CR_MODEL_LOOKUP=0 to keep it off) and estimated in the meantime,
# rather than left to disarm the trigger. codex states its
# window in the rollout, and has thresholds of its own: CR_CODEX_CONTEXT_PCT,
# counted the way its status line counts "Context N% used" (claude's percentage
# unless set), and CR_CODEX_CONTEXT_TOKENS, which is never borrowed. If that
# restart is aborted after the fold already reached the session, CR_CANCEL_MSG
# is typed instead of just leaving the session be — default:
# "The context restart was cancelled — the handoff is not needed now. Continue
# with what you were doing before it was requested."
#
# While it runs there is a dim `◆ cr` in a corner of the screen — the wrapper's
# only visible output. CR_BADGE=0 removes it.
#
# CR_AGENTS_OVERLAY=1 annotates each row of Claude Code's own subagent tree with
# the model that agent is actually running on (read from its transcript, never
# from the spawn request, which the model is free to ignore) — off by default,
# since it means running a small terminal emulator over everything claude draws.
# CR_AGENTS_POS (right|label, default right) picks where the annotation goes;
# CR_AGENTS_POLL_SEC (default 1) how often the subagent files are re-read; and
# CR_PAT_AGENT_ROW is the pattern that finds a tree row on screen, in case
# Claude Code's own render of it ever changes shape. CR_PAT_AGENTS_PANEL_ROW is
# the same, for the separate row shape drawn in the persistent panel opened by
# typing /tasks while a subagent is still running (no tree glyph; a
# "(running)"/"(done)" marker instead) — both are annotated the same way.
#
# On startup it says so when a newer release exists, with the command that
# updates the copy you are actually running — brew, git, or a link. The check
# itself runs in the background and is read from a cache next time, so a session
# never waits on it. CR_UPDATE_CHECK=0 turns the whole thing off.
#
# Set CR_DISABLE=1 to bypass the wrapper entirely.

#
# Detection requires a LIMIT line AND a RESET line near each other (or a
# structured `"error":"rate_limit"` transcript record, which needs no pattern at
# all). That pairing is what keeps prose about limits from triggering a retry.

# of anything the rollout shows, and it does so in the middle of a turn. So:
#   - its threshold is moved out of the way, passing codex
#     -c model_auto_compact_token_limit_scope="body_after_prefix" and a huge
#     model_auto_compact_token_limit, which leaves only its hard cap at 95% of
#     the window (258.4k) — a cap nothing can move;
#   - the count is read where codex writes the number it compares against that
#     cap: the "post sampling token usage" rows of $CODEX_HOME/logs_*.sqlite;
#   - a turn still running when the count gets within CR_CODEX_RESERVE_TOKENS of

"""claude-retrier PTY supervisor.

Runs claude on a pty we own, forwards bytes both ways untouched, and watches two
independent channels for "the session stopped because the quota ran out":

  1. the JSONL transcript  — structured, `"error":"rate_limit"`. Primary.
  2. the output stream     — pattern pairing. Fallback for when (1) is unavailable.

When a limit is seen it computes the wall-clock wait, sleeps, and types the retry
message into the pty — but only while the human is idle and claude is not busy.
The wait also ends early if the session starts answering again, which is the only
evidence there is that a limit lifted before the reset it announced.

# codex — the same two questions, asked of a different file
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# codex keeps one JSONL "rollout" per thread under
# $CODEX_HOME/sessions/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/, and it says more than Claude Code's
# transcript does: the turn boundaries are in it, so is the size of the context
# window, and so is the reason a turn ended. Nothing here has to be inferred
# from the screen.
#
# The rows that matter, all shaped `{"type": …, "payload": {"type": …}}`:
#
#   event_msg / task_started     a turn began, and the window it runs in.
#   event_msg / task_complete    a turn ended. With no `error` it ended well;
#                                with one, `codex_error_info` separates "the
#                                account ran out" from "the server did".
#   event_msg / turn_aborted     a turn ended because someone pressed Esc.
#   event_msg / token_count      what the last request was sent with, and how
#                                large the window is: the context trigger's two
#                                numbers, in codex's own accounting.
#   response_item / message      role "user" is the echo of what was typed;
#                                role "assistant" is the session answering.
#   turn_context                 which model (0.154); older builds said it in
#   event_msg / thread_settings_applied   instead.
#
# The turn boundaries are what a context restart leans on. Claude Code writes a
# stop_reason into every answer and codex writes none, so "the folding turn
# closed cleanly" is read off task_complete instead — the same fact, stated by
# the runtime rather than the model — and "the session is mid-turn" is the span
# between task_started and its ending, which stays true while the root sits for
# minutes waiting on its agents without writing a byte.
#
# The error that prompted all of this is a turn ending with
# `{"message": "Selected model is at capacity. …", "codex_error_info":
# "server_overloaded"}` — a stall: no reset time, no way out of itself, and on a
# session running agents it takes every one of them down with it.

#                    naming the API id and a row naming the context window.

             disarmed trigger is silent by construction, which looks exactly
